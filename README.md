# Sublime Text ScalaScript Package
This is a package designed to extend Sublime Text to enable support for scipting for the [Scala digital signage platform](http://www.scala.com/).

For those new to the ScalaScript language the lexical rules may be found in the [Scala Designer documentation](https://docs.scala.com/display/D1100/The+ScalaScript+Language). Documentation for the builtin libraries may also be found [here](http://forms.scala.com/advancedscripting/syntaxdocs5/commands.html).
